# 🎙️ Web Voice Recorder & Speech-to-Text

A **web-based voice recording application** that records audio directly from the browser, **automatically splits recordings every 30 minutes**, stores them on the server, and **converts audio to text (Speech-to-Text)**.

This project is designed for **long-duration recording** use cases such as monitoring, logging, interviews, and documentation — **without additional hardware**, using only a modern browser.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* 🎤 Browser-based audio recording (no plugin, no hardware)
* ⏱️ Automatic audio split every **30 minutes**
* 💾 Server-side storage (PHP)
* ▶️ Playback recorded audio directly from the web UI
* 📝 Speech-to-Text conversion (Whisper / Google / Vosk – pluggable)
* 📅 Recording history with date & time
* 🔐 Secure microphone permission (HTTPS)

---

## 🎯 Application Goals

* Enable **continuous audio recording** via web browser
* Prevent large file issues by **auto-splitting audio**
* Provide **structured audio logs** with timestamps
* Convert voice recordings into **searchable text data**
* Reduce dependency on desktop/mobile native apps

---

## 🧩 Use Cases

### 1️⃣ Voice Logging / Monitoring

* Control room monitoring
* Operational voice logs
* Shift handover documentation

### 2️⃣ Meeting & Interview Recording

* Long meetings (>1 hour)
* Interviews
* Research data collection

### 3️⃣ Voice-based Documentation

* Field reporting
* Verbal daily reports
* Knowledge capture

### 4️⃣ Speech-to-Text Automation

* Convert voice → text for analysis
* Index & search spoken content
* Integration with reporting systems

    participant B as Browser
    participant S as Server

    U->>B: Click Start Record
    B->>B: Request Mic Permission
    B->>B: Start MediaRecorder

    loop Every 30 Minutes
        B->>S: Upload Audio Chunk
        S->>S: Save Audio File
        S->>B: Upload Success
    end

    U->>B: Click Stop Record
    B->>B: Stop Recorder
```

    participant STT as Speech-to-Text Engine
    participant DB as Database

    S->>STT: Send Audio File
    STT->>S: Transcribed Text
    S->>DB: Save Text + Metadata
```

## ⚠️ Requirements & Limitations

* ✅ HTTPS required (except localhost)
* ✅ User interaction required (Start button)
* ❌ Browser tab must remain open
* ❌ Not suitable for background recording on mobile

## 📊 Storage Estimation

| Duration | Bitrate | File Size |
| -------- | ------- | --------- |
| 30 min   | 32 kbps | ~43 MB    |
| 1 hour   | 32 kbps | ~86 MB    |
| 24 hour  | 32 kbps | ~2 GB     |

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

* Microphone access requires explicit user consent
* HTTPS enforced by browser
* Server-side validation on uploads
* Optional authentication layer

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* ⏯ Resume recording after refresh
* 🧠 Silence detection
* 🔎 Full-text search on transcription
* ☁️ Cloud storage (S3 / GCS)
* 📊 Analytics dashboard
* 👥 Multi-user support
